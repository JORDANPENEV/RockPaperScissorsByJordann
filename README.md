# RockPaperScissorsByJordann
1)This is a simple console game "Rock Paper Scissoers".
2)The game is designed purely for entertainment purposes and is not intended to impart any educational value.
3) I created this code based on the knowledge I acquired during the school year, as well as thanks to my logical thinking skills. The explanation of the code in a few lines is as follows:*I import the random module, which allows us to generate random numbers. It is necessary for selecting random moves by the computer.*I define the moves by creating three variables representing the possible moves in the game: rock, paper, and scissors.*I use a while True loop to create an infinite loop that will continue to run until it is broken with break. This allows me to play the game multiple times.*The next line of code prompts the user to enter their move via the keyboard, and input() reads the input as a string.*Then, I check what move the player has chosen (r, p, s) and convert it to the corresponding string (Rock, Paper, Scissors). If the input is not valid, I display an invalid input message and start a new loop with continue.*The next step is to generate a random move for the computer by creating a variable ai_move that will contain the computer's move. I use random.randint(1, 3) to generate a random number between 1 and 3, which I use to select the computer's move. Based on the value of computer_random_number, I assign the corresponding move to ai_move and print the computer's choice.*The next step is to compare the user's and the computer's input and display an appropriate game result. If the player wins, I print "You win!". If there is a tie, I print "Draw!". If the computer wins, I print "You lose!".*The final part of the code prompts the player to play again. If the player types "yes" (regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters, thanks to lower()), the game continues. Otherwise, I print "Thanks for playing!" and break the while loop, which terminates the program.*In conclusion, I can summarize the used Python constructs:Input and output (input() and print()),Conditional operators (if, elif, else),Loops (while),String handling (checks and comparisons),Generating random numbers (random.randint()).I hope this description was helpful! -jordan_penev
